This project is adopted CNN Keras Model to classify MNIST dataset as well as train and validate it. The trained data is stored on .h5 file which will be called on the CLI program to predict external hand-written digit image. In order to run the CLIProgram.py at the same time with the external image, open your terminal (go the directory which contains CLIProgram.py) 

$ python CLIProgram.py image.png  

Note : If the image file is not placed at the same directory, open the image based on the directory  Example 

$ python CLIProgram.py /Users/abc/Downloads/image.png
